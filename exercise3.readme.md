# Subtask 3.1
*3.1 Identify which would be *valid* values of 'alist' and 'avalue' that cause the function not to
behave according to its specification (or are ambiguous with respect to the specification of the
function that appears in the statement).*


**Duplicate Pairs**: 
<p>In the given implementation, the nested loops consider every element twice, meaning pairs like (1, 3) and (3, 1) are treated as separate pairs, which is not necessary if order does not matter. The pairs (2, 2) might be ambiguous if we are looking for unique elements only.</p>

**Self-Pairing Issue**: 
<p>Pairs like (2, 2) in the result may cause ambiguity. The function should clarify whether pairs of the same element are allowed or if unique pairs only are expected.</p>

**Ambiguity with an Empty List or Single Element:**

If alist contains one element or is empty, the function returns an empty list, but this could be ambiguous as it may not be clear whether this result is due to no pairs or a limitation of the function.

**Ambiguity with Non-Integer Values**:

If alist contains non-integer values (like strings or floats), the behavior of the function might be unpredictable.


# <br> Subtask 3.2
*3.2 The current implementation is not efficient. Indicate the order of complexity of the same.*

The current implementation uses two nested loops, both iterating through the entire list. Thus, the time complexity of this implementation is O(n²), where n is the length of alist.

*3.2 The current implementation is not efficient. Indicate the order of complexity of the same.*

The current implementation uses two nested loops, both iterating through the entire list. Thus, the time complexity of this implementation is O(n²), where `n` is the length of `alist`.


# <br> Subtask 3.3
*3.3 Implement a more efficient version that, if possible, does not have the problems we
identified in the 3.1 exercise.*

To optimize the function, we can use a hash set to track visited elements. This allows us to find pairs in a single pass through the list, reducing the complexity.

```
function getPairsForValue(alist, avalue) {
    let ret = [];
    let seen = new Set();

    for (let num of alist) {
        let complement = avalue - num;
        
        // Check if the complement has been seen already
        if (seen.has(complement)) {
            // Ensure pairs are added in sorted order to avoid (num, complement) and (complement, num) as separate pairs
            ret.push([Math.min(num, complement), Math.max(num, complement)]);
        };
        
        // Add the current number to the set of seen elements
        seen.add(num);
    };
    
    return ret;
};
```

# <br> Subtask 3.3.1
*3.3.1 Indicate the order of complexity of the new version*

The optimized solution has a time complexity of O(n), where `n` is the length of `alist`, due to a single pass through the list.
